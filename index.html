          to approach your family members. If more members in your family are
          earning members, then the same allowance can be donated to needy

          this right? Are we not human?” While it is expected that
          repatriation [of Rohingya refugees to Myanmar] will take place
          within two years, the children and adolescents in the camps will
          lose their golden time for learning which is a global concern. …
          [Bangladesh] issued guidelines to provide “informal” learning …

          concerns. “We have a saying: if you want to destroy a community you
          don’t have to kill the people, just prevent them from studying,”
